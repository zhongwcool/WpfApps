# App12.SQLite

You don't need to install any database software. You can use SQLite.

## [Hotel System](https://github.com/mentapro/HotelSystem)

This is a hotel system that can be used to book a room for a certain period of time.

- MVVM Example
- Entity Framework Example
- WPF

This application (WPF) works with database SQLite through Entity Framework.
I tried to write clean code. I used MVVM pattern and followed SOLID principles.

Current application represents database for hotel. There are rooms and clients. Each room can contain many clients but
one client can live only in one room.
User interface is written in XAML. XAML elements use binding to show data.
